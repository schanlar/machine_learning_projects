## Predicting musical valence of Spotify songs

This was a project assignment for the completion of an ML course offered by [mathesis](https://mathesis.cup.gr/). The documentation within notebooks is in Greek. 

### Goal of project

Spotify uses the valence metric which corresponds to how happy a track is. This metric was not developed by Spotify itself. It was originally developed by Echo Nest, a company that was bought by Spotify in 2014. We don't know exactly how the valence of each track is calculated. There are some details in a blog post which can be found here:

Our goal is to be able to find a way to calculate the valence of a track. For this purpose we will use Spotify's API, following the instructions here: [https://developer.spotify.com/](https://developer.spotify.com/)

As a basis we will use the data for tracks that have been in the top positions of listeners in different countries, which can be found here: [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4778562](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4778562) and in the ``charts.zip`` file.
